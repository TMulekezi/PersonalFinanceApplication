# PersonalFinanceApplication
The goal of this project was to develop a gamified personal finance application that runs locally on a host port of the user's PC and is accessible in a browser window. The application sought to incorporate the main personal finance tools found among market-leading applications as well as utilise gamification techniques that have not yet been introduced to main stream personal finance systems but have been heavily used in other industries. Application robustness to unexpected usage, security and usability, were key objectives during the application development to enhance the userâ€™s experience as much as possible. 

The application's main objectives were achieved through the implementation of a client-server architecture split into database, application and client layers. The database layer was developed using a MySQL relational database management system deployed remotely on an Amazon RDS server. The application layer was implemented using the Spring Boot extension for Java and followed the MVC design pattern. The client layer facilitated user interaction with the program through Thymeleaf templates, written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The communication of user information between the layers was handled automatically at application runtime using developer libraries as dependencies. 

The application was manually tested and results showed that the application objectives were achieved.
